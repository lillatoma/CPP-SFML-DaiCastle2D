# Locker Menu
## Left-side
### Character View
The Character View shows how the user's character looks like with the currently equipped cosmetics.  
A random background ground-texture is drawn. Clicking on it changes the texture.  
There are three render-modes for the character view:  
- **Skin:** Shows the currently equipped character skin.  
- **Glider:** Shows the currently equipped glider with the character under.  
- **Wrap:** Shows the curretly equipped character skin with a random item that has the currently equipped weapon wrap.  
Choosing between the render-modes can be done by clicking on the appropriate buttons on the right side of the Character View.  

## Right-side
### Locker inventory
On the right-side, all the unlocked cosmetics are shown in a type according to the `Character View` render-mode. 
For example, having Glider as render-mode will only show the unlocked gliders. 
The currently selected cosmetic is highlighted by a white rectangle outline. Clicking on an unlocked item will select the cosmetic for the user.  

## Bottom-side
### Upcoming item list
A showcase of cosmetics connected to some tiers is visible.  
Already unlocked tiers are highlighted with a yellow rectangle outline, while the current tier is highlighted with a white rectangle outline.  
The two arrows on the left, and right allow the user to see upcoming cosmetics, and already unlocked ones.  
Hovering the mouse over a cosmetic will show it under the `Character View`, with the same background.
7 cosmetics are visible at once.  

## Back button
In the top left corner, there is a yellow button with the text "Back".  
Clicking on this button directs the user back to the `Main Menu`.

## Quit button
On the top-right corner, a red button with an X in the middle is visible. Clicking on it opens the `Quit prompt`.
The `Quit prompt` is a panel with a question "Would you like to quit?" and two buttons `No` and `Yes`. Clicking on `No` closes the `Quit prompt`. Clicking on `Yes` saves the profile information to `profile.md`, saves the configuration to `cfg\config.cfg` and closes the application.
