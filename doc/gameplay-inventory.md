# Inventory

## Accessing the inventory
Pressing the button bound to the action key `Open Inventory` opens and closes the inventory.

## Looks
When the inventory is open, the background (the game) gets darker, and a black panel is visible on the right side of the screen.  
On the bottom of this black panel, 5 small square sized panels are visible, representing the current items of the currently watched player.  
Empty slots are only black squares, with no object rendered on.  
If the user hovers their mouse on one of these items, the same item will be shown above in a panel with its major attributes.  

## Actions
If the user's character is alive, actions can be performed while the inventory tab is open:  
- **Dropping an item:** This can be performed by clicking on and dragging an item out of the black panel.  
- **Swapping two items:** This can be performed by clicking on and dragging an item on another item.  
- **Putting an item to another empty slot:** This can be performed by clicking on and dragging an item on an empty slot.
