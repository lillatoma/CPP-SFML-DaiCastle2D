# Airdrops
Airdrops are very rare boexes that drop 2 legendary or mythic weapons, and 3 non-bandage healing items.  
Airdrops spawn 120-360 seconds into the game, and from that point, airdrops randomly spawn 60-360 after the previous airdrop spawn.  
Airdrops take 4 seconds to open.  
Airdrops attract nearby bots that want better loot.
