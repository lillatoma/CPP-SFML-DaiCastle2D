## Toggleable button: Record Demos

## Refresh button:
Clicking on this button reloads all the names of the `.dem` files from the `demos\` folder.
## Play button:
If a demo is selected, clicking on this button opens the selected demo in the `Demo viewer`.

## Back button
In the top left corner, there is a yellow button with the text "Back".  
Clicking on this button directs the user back to the `Main Menu`.

## Quit button
On the top-right corner, a red button with an X in the middle is visible. Clicking on it opens the `Quit prompt`.
The `Quit prompt` is a panel with a question "Would you like to quit?" and two buttons `No` and `Yes`. Clicking on `No` closes the `Quit prompt`. Clicking on `Yes` saves the profile information to `profile.md`, saves the configuration to `cfg\config.cfg` and closes the application.
